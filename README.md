# Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew!

#### I write code. Some of it even works!
## I'm a developer, engineer, and volunteer emergency services officer in Melbourne, Australia.
- **Background in synthetic chemistry, physics, game development and enterprise management.**
- *Possible* rubber duck. <img src="https://github.com/AndrewKhassapov/AndrewKhassapov/blob/main/rubber-duck-transparent.png" width="25" height="25"/>

#### What am I doing here?

- ðŸ’¡ðŸ§  Using this neat version control to access updates from anywhere.
Thank you GitHub :octocat:!

- ðŸŒ± Always learning the ongoing development of new .js frameworks, a bit of python data processing, and fine-tuning in my favourite C#.

- ðŸ”“ðŸ”’ Storing most projects which are either proprietary or private. Which is why contributions look infrequent: â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›.

- Finishing off everybody's favourite **untitled-project-v2**! ðŸ”¥

# Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew!

#### I write code. Some of it even works!
### I'm a developer, engineer, and volunteer emergency services officer in Melbourne, Australia.

#### What am I doing here?
- ðŸ’¡ðŸ§  Version control access from anywhere!
- ðŸŒ± Always learning the ongoing development of new .js frameworks, a bit of python data processing, and fine-tuning in my favourite C#.
- ðŸ”“ðŸ”’ Storing most projects which are either proprietary or private. Which is why contributions look infrequent: â¬›â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›.
- Finishing off everybody's favourite **untitled-project-v2**! ðŸ”¥

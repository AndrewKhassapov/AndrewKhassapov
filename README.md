# Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew!

#### I write code. Some of it even ends up finished!
### I'm a developer, engineer, and volunteer emergency services officer in Melbourne, Australia.

#### What am I doing here?
- ğŸ’¡ğŸ§  Figuring out this version control, and developing skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence,
- ğŸŒ± Always learning the barrage of new .js frameworks, a little bit of python and fine-tuning in my favourite C#.
- ğŸ”“ğŸ”’ Storing most projects which are either proprietary or still in development, which is why contributions look infrequent publicly: â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©â¬›â¬›.
- Finishing off everybody's favourite **unnamed-project-v2**! ğŸ”¥
